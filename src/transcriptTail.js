 * split it into lines, on every redraw, for the sake of three skill names
 * at the very end of it. Reading the last 2 MB through a file descriptor
 * took 9 ms and parsing that took 8 ms.
 *
 * So the read walks backwards in chunks and stops as soon as it has what
 * it came for. Two things bound it: a byte cap, so a pathological
 * transcript cannot consume the redraw, and a time budget, so a slow disk
 * cannot either. Both are reported back, because "no skills were used
 * recently" and "the scan gave up" are different answers and the
