/**
 * Fitting the bar to the terminal it is actually in.
 *
 * Two facts drive this module. Claude Code sets `COLUMNS` and `LINES` before
 * running the command, so the real dimensions are knowable rather than
 * assumed at 120 columns and four rows. And with thirty-four segments
 * competing for those columns, most redraws cannot show everything, so
 * something is always being dropped.
 *
 * The only question is whether that choice was made on purpose. Source order
 * made it by accident: the last segment added was the first one lost,
 * regardless of what it said. Here it is made by the priority in the
 * registry, the way iTerm2's status bar has done it for years.
 *
 * Position and presence stay separate. Priority decides whether a segment
 * appears; its order decides where. A segment therefore never slides
 * sideways because a neighbour disappeared, and the eye can learn where
 * things are.
