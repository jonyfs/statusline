/**
 * The per-session record of skill invocations written by the optional
 * `PostToolUse` hook.
 *
 * Why it exists: the transcript is written when Claude Code flushes it, so
 * a skill invoked a moment ago may not be readable yet. The hook fires at
 * the invocation itself, so the line reacts on the next redraw rather than
 * whenever the file catches up.
 *
 * Why the fallback stays: a hook is a second place for behaviour to live.
 * Anyone who skipped it, uses another machine, or edits their settings
 * would otherwise see a silently different statusline. The transcript scan
 * remains the source of truth; this only makes it faster (FR-019).
 *
 * The file is appended to, one JSON object per line, so a hook writing
 * while a redraw reads can never produce half a record.
