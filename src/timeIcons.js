/**
 * How a reset moment reads to a human.
 *
 * Until 2026-09-06 this file also mapped a reset time onto one of Unicode's
 * 24 clock-face emoji, so the icon on the reset segment carried the hour
 * rather than decorating it. That segment is gone: each window now draws its
 * own reset beside its own level, and a face showing the absolute hour next
 * to a relative countdown said the same thing twice in two units, which was
 * a good part of why line 4 was hard to read. The faces went with it.
 *
 * There is still deliberately no attempt to encode the *day* in an emoji:
 * Unicode has no per-weekday or per-date glyph (📅 📆 🗓️ are generic), so the
 * weekday is rendered as text next to the calendar icon rather than faked
 * with a symbol that does not mean what it appears to.

 * make an imminent reset look further away than it is.
