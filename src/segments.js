/**
 * The segment registry: one row per thing the bar can show.
 *
 * Segment definitions used to live inline in the renderer, which was fine
 * for fifteen of them and stops being fine at thirty-four. Three properties
 * in particular need to be readable without reading a render function:
 *
 * - `priority` decides what survives a narrow terminal. With more content
 *   than columns, something is always being dropped; the only question is
 *   whether the choice was made on purpose. Source order made it by
 *   accident, so the last segment added was the first one lost.
 * - `order` decides position, and is deliberately separate from priority.
 *   A segment never moves because a neighbour disappeared, so the eye can
 *   learn where things are.
 * - `colour` says which of the three channels a segment uses, and the tests
 *   enforce that it is only ever one. Principle X, as amended, requires a
 *   colour on the bar to mean one thing wherever it appears.
 *
 * The priority values come from the table in
 * specs/002-statusline-design-review/data-model.md, agreed on 2026-08-26.
 * Changing one changes what a person sees on an 80-column terminal, which
 * is why they live here, in a diff, rather than in a layout pass.
