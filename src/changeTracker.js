/**
 * Marks segments that changed since the previous render, and cycles their

 *
 * The honest constraint this is built around: a statusline is printed
 * once per render and then it is static text — there is no timer, no
 * redraw loop, and no way for this process to animate anything after it
 * exits. Frames therefore advance per render, and Claude Code re-renders
 * roughly every 5-6 seconds during activity (measured, not assumed). The
 * result reads as a slow pulse that draws the eye to what changed, not as
 * smooth motion, and if nothing triggers a re-render the icon simply
 * holds on its current frame.

 * seen the previous frame. The segment keeps its own hue, so it still says
 * which segment it is.
 *
 * The list is short on purpose. Principle X, as amended, requires each
 * colour channel to carry one meaning, so these four are exactly the
